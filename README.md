Okay, so I just stumbled out of the theater after 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 Warfare and I’m not even sure where to start. My brain feels like a blender trying to crush ice—which by the way, is not a compliment. I mean, what did I just 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩, a tactical war seminar or a  ? There’s like more dialogue than action, and not the good kind. It’s like listening to my uncle rant about taxes at Thanksgiving and then suddenly he flips the table over.

They tried to make it all dramatic and meaningful, like one of those serious paintings you’re supposed to stare at for hours. But really, half the time I felt like I was lost at sea on a boat made of clichés. Each character was carrying emotional baggage heavier than travelers in an airport before extra charges existed but does anyone unpack any of it? Of course not. It’s like they’re afraid they’ll spill their feelings like a cheap martini at happy hour.

> Oh and the soundtrack—man, it sounds like they just 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥ed the first generic war playlist they found 𝘰𝘯𝘭𝘪𝘯𝘦. Random violins, some intense drumbeats, blah blah, there was even a harmonica randomly. Whatever, I already forgot most of it while I was trying not to fall asleep halfway through the third act. The war scenes? Yeah, guns and chaos, you know the drill. Fire, smoke, people yelling, like my neighbor's backyard BBQ gone wrong.

Did I mention how some of the characters make decisions? Characters literally jumping from one thought to another like they're trying to dodge bullets. Makes me remember that one time I decided it was a good idea to run a marathon after bowling four straight games. Bad idea. Their decisions were… let’s say “creative,” with all the sarcasm here.

int dramaticTension = 0;
if (sceneNeedsAction){
  dramaticTension = calculateSurprise();
}

I mean, if you like  s that are like puzzles, go ahead and 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the  . Just maybe bring a friend who can explain it to you—or maybe a self-help book for those times the plot suddenly implodes into an existential crisis. The views? Okay, there were a couple nice views. Got to give it that. Majestic landscapes that looked like screensavers from the early 2000s. 

In conclusion... Wait, conclusion? Who am I kidding? Basically, if you want a couple of hours of existential dread mixed with occasional excitement, go 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   and have fun, I guess. I’ll be over here, trying to figure out if I really enjoyed it or if it just bamboozled me. Bamboozled is the word.
